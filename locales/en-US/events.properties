maker_party_paragraph_1=Since 2012, Mozilla’s Maker Party has been a place for artists to connect with educators; for activists to trade ideas with coders; and for entrepreneurs to chat with makers. It’s a place to network, innovate and make a difference.
maker_party_paragraph_2=This year, we’ll come together with this same spirit, but also with a mission — to challenge outdated copyright laws. We believe the internet’s potential for innovation and collaboration is sacred and, without reform, at risk.
